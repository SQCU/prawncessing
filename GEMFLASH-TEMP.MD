# GEMFLASH-TEMP.MD: `dct_refurb` Feature Analysis

This report summarizes the completed, partially implemented, and unimplemented features of the `dct_refurb` service, based on an analysis of its documentation (`README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md`, and `api_debugging_notes.md`). It also identifies potential outdated or bogus claims and proposes validation approaches.

## Completed Features

Based on the documentation, the following features appear to be fully implemented and functional:

*   **Standalone Service:** The `dct_refurb` service is designed to be autonomous, with its own dedicated startup (`start_services.sh`), shutdown (`interrupt_services.sh`), and port-killing (`kill_ports.sh`) scripts.
*   **Multi-Process Service Mesh:** The core architecture is a multi-process service mesh orchestrated by `main.py`, launching `ServiceMapper`, `WorkerService` instances, and a `web_server` in separate processes.
*   **ServiceMapper (Control Plane):** This central discovery service registers workers, handles client queries for worker locations, tracks worker load, and de-registers stale services.
*   **WorkerService (Workhorse):** Individual worker instances register with the `ServiceMapper`, report their health, and listen for job requests from peers.
*   **Image Generation Logic:** The `core_logic/image_generation.py` module contains the pure, stateless business logic for generating timestamped images.
*   **Web Server (FastAPI):** The `api/web_server.py` provides a web-facing API, serving `index.html` and offering a WebSocket endpoint for real-time image streaming to the browser.

## Partially Implemented/Buggy Features

*   **`/api/services` Endpoint:** An attempt to add a new `/api/services` endpoint to `web_server.py` consistently results in a 404 Not Found error. This indicates that while the code for the endpoint and its supporting `list_peers` method in `WorkerService` have been added, the endpoint is not being correctly exposed or loaded by the running web server process.

## Unimplemented Features

The documentation does not explicitly list any unimplemented features. The `/api/services` endpoint, currently buggy, was likely a newly added feature that was not yet fully functional.

## Outdated/Bogus Claims & Validation Approaches

### 1. Claim: `web_server.py` code changes are not being loaded due to multiprocessing context caching.

*   **Source:** `api_debugging_notes.md`
*   **Analysis:** This is a strong hypothesis presented as the likely cause for the persistent 404 on the `/api/services` endpoint. It needs to be definitively validated.
*   **Validation Approach:**
    1.  **Modify `web_server.py`:** Add a new, extremely simple endpoint to `web_server.py`:
        ```python
        @app.get("/hello")
        async def hello_world():
            return {"message": "Hello from dct_refurb!"}
        ```
    2.  **Restart Service:** Execute `bash start_services.sh` from the `dct_refurb` directory.
    3.  **Test Endpoints:** Use `curl` or a web browser to access both `http://localhost:<web_server_port>/hello` and `http://localhost:<web_server_port>/api/services`. (Note: The exact port for the web server needs to be determined, likely from `main.py` or `start_services.sh` logs).
    4.  **Expected Outcome:**
        *   **If the claim is TRUE (caching issue):** Both `/hello` and `/api/services` will return 404. This confirms that changes to `web_server.py` are not being picked up.
        *   **If the claim is FALSE (not a caching issue):** `/hello` will return the "Hello from dct_refurb!" message, but `/api/services` will still return 404. This indicates the problem lies specifically within the `get_services` function or its interaction with `WorkerService`, not a general code loading problem.

### 2. Claim: The application provides "real-time data processing and visualization."

*   **Source:** `ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md`
*   **Analysis:** This is a high-level architectural goal. While the components are in place, the end-to-end real-time visualization needs to be confirmed.
*   **Validation Approach:**
    1.  **Start Service:** Execute `bash start_services.sh` from the `dct_refurb` directory.
    2.  **Access Frontend:** Open `index.html` (served by `web_server.py`) in a web browser.
    3.  **Observe Visualization:** Monitor the web page to see if images are being streamed and updated dynamically in real-time via the WebSocket connection.
    4.  **Expected Outcome:** The web page should display continuously updated images, confirming the real-time visualization aspect. If not, investigate the WebSocket connection, image streaming logic, and client-side rendering.

### 3. Claim: The `ServiceMapper` "tracks the load of each worker to prevent overloading and de-registers stale services."

*   **Source:** `ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md`
*   **Analysis:** This describes advanced load balancing and service health management features of the `ServiceMapper`. These are critical but not easily verifiable from external observation alone.
*   **Validation Approach (Load Tracking):**
    1.  **Simulate Load:** Modify `worker_service.py` to introduce a configurable delay (e.g., `time.sleep()`) in the `generate_image()` function to simulate varying worker loads.
    2.  **Monitor Mapper State:** If possible, enable verbose logging for the `ServiceMapper` or add a debug endpoint to `service_mapper.py` to inspect its internal state regarding worker load.
    3.  **Test Routing:** Send a high volume of image generation requests and observe if the `ServiceMapper` correctly distributes requests, avoiding overloaded workers, or if it queues/rejects requests as expected.
*   **Validation Approach (Stale Service De-registration):**
    1.  **Start Worker:** Launch a `WorkerService` instance.
    2.  **Terminate Worker:** Gracefully terminate the `WorkerService` process (e.g., `kill -TERM <worker_pid>`) or, for a more robust test, forcefully terminate it (`kill -9 <worker_pid>`).
    3.  **Monitor Mapper Logs:** Observe the `ServiceMapper`'s logs for messages indicating the de-registration of the worker after a certain timeout period.
    4.  **Query Mapper:** Attempt to query the `ServiceMapper` for the terminated worker's status after the expected de-registration time to confirm it's no longer listed as active.
