# API Debugging Notes: The Case of the 404 Error

## Summary of Attempts

My primary goal is to add a new `/api/services` endpoint to the `web_server.py` file. So far, I have correctly added the new route using the `@app.get("/api/services")` decorator in the FastAPI web server. I also added the necessary supporting methods (`list_peers`) to the `WorkerService` to fetch the data from the `ServiceMapper`. Despite multiple restarts of the service using the provided `start_dct_refurb.sh` script, the new endpoint consistently returns a 404 Not Found error. I have verified the syntax of the new endpoint and its supporting functions, and they appear correct. I also attempted to change the import alias in `main.py` to rule out any obscure import caching issues, but this had no effect.

## Review of Tooling and Documentation

According to the FastAPI documentation, using the `@app.get()` decorator on a function is the standard and correct way to register a new HTTP GET route. The `uvicorn` server, which is used to run the FastAPI application, should automatically detect all routes registered on the `app` instance that is passed to `uvicorn.run()`. The persistence of the 404 error suggests that the problem is not a simple syntax error in `web_server.py`, but rather an issue in the runtime environment. It seems likely that the `web_server` process, when launched from `main.py`, is not running the latest version of the code, despite the restarts. The multiprocessing context might be holding on to a cached version of the module.

## Next Steps for Diagnosis

My immediate next step is to determine if *any* code changes in `web_server.py` are being picked up by the running process. To do this, I will add a second, extremely simple, new endpoint: `@app.get("/hello")`. This route will have no dependencies on other services and will simply return a static JSON object. After adding this code, I will restart the service and test both the `/hello` and `/api/services` endpoints. If `/hello` works and `/api/services` still fails, the problem lies within the `get_services` function or its interaction with the `WorkerService`. However, if `/hello` *also* returns a 404, it will confirm my suspicion that the `web_server` process is not loading the new code at all, and I will need to investigate the `main.py` orchestration and process management more deeply.
