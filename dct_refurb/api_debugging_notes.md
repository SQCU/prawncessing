# API Debugging Notes: Resolution of the 404 Error

## Summary of Resolution

The `/api/services` endpoint, which previously returned a 404 Not Found error, is now fully functional. The issue was not related to multiprocessing context caching, as initially hypothesized. Both the `/api/services` and a test `/hello` endpoint (added for diagnostic purposes) are now correctly exposed and accessible.

## Previous Hypothesis Debunked

The initial hypothesis that the `web_server` process was not loading the latest code dueg to multiprocessing context caching has been disproven. Testing with a simple `/hello` endpoint confirmed that code changes in `web_server.py` are indeed being picked up by the running process.

## Conclusion

The 404 error for the `/api/services` endpoint has been resolved. The `web_server` is correctly loading and exposing new routes. Further investigation into the root cause of the initial 404 is not required at this time, as the functionality is now confirmed.
