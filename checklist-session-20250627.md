### Within-Session Checklist: June 27, 2025

#### Goal: Enhance Visualizer Communication and Code Clarity

*   **Success Rubric:** The web visualizer successfully communicates with backend services via a reverse proxy using REST API, and the inter-service router code is clearly documented to prevent future CORS and coupling issues.
*   **Failure Rubric:** CORS errors persist, REST API communication is not fully implemented, or the inter-service router documentation is incomplete or unclear.

#### Subordinate Goals:

*   **[X] Refactor Visualizer for REST API & Reverse Proxy:**
    *   *Description:* Modify the web visualizer and associated backend services to communicate exclusively via REST API endpoints, routed through a reverse proxy to eliminate CORS issues.
    *   *Success Rubric:* All visualizer data fetches and command sends are successful through the reverse proxy, and no CORS errors are observed.
    *   *Failure Rubric:* CORS errors re-emerge, or the visualizer fails to communicate with backend services via the new setup.
    *   *Note:* The reverse proxy has been configured to only handle API requests. Static files (HTML, JS, CSS) are served by a separate `visualizer_server.py` to maintain a clear separation of concerns.


*   **[X] Document Inter-Service Router Role:**
    *   *Description:* Add clear, concise comments to the inter-service router code, explaining its functional role in preventing CORS errors and avoiding unnecessary coupling between unrelated functions.
    *   *Success Rubric:* The added comments accurately describe the router's purpose and benefits, are idiomatic to the existing codebase, and enhance code readability.
    *   *Failure Rubric:* Comments are missing, inaccurate, or do not adequately explain the router's role in addressing CORS and coupling.

### Meta-Goal: Improve Agent Handoff and Workflow

*   **[X] Diagnose and Address Agent Looping:**
    *   *Description:* Analyze project meta-files to understand the cause of unproductive agent loops and propose a solution.
    *   *Success Rubric:* A new, robust workflow is established and documented.
*   **[X] Establish "Baton Pass" Protocol:**
    *   *Description:* Create and document a new protocol for agent handoffs to ensure consistent, incremental progress.
    *   *Success Rubric:* The protocol is formalized in `GEMINI.md` and a `handoffs/` directory is created.
*   **[X] Refine Protocol with Live Tracing:**
    *   *Description:* Update the protocol to include live logging of agent plans and actions.
    *   *Success Rubric:* The "Baton Pass Protocol (v2 - Live Tracing)" is documented in `GEMINI.md`.
