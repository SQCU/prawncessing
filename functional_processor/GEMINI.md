## Dubious Files Warning

The following files in this directory (`functional_processor/`) are currently in a dubious state and may contain overlapping or destructive edits due to previous unaddressed issues with precise file modifications:

- `image_input_service.py`
- `test_image_input_service.py`

These files should be reviewed and potentially recreated or carefully refactored before further development relies on their current content.

## Log File Convention

Log files generated by scripts in this directory should be directed to the `functional_processor/logs/` subdirectory, not the script's own directory. This ensures better organization and separation of concerns.
