### Milestone 1: Refine Web Visualizer & Data Pipeline

*   **Success Rubric:** The web visualizer successfully displays processed video, allows user interaction, and maintains stable communication with backend services.
*   **Subordinate Goals:**
    *   [ ] **Implement Robust Data Flow:** Ensure video data flows correctly and efficiently from the mock server, through the functional processing pipeline, and to the web visualizer.
        *   *Success Rubric:* Unit and integration tests for data flow components pass, demonstrating reliable data transmission.
    *   [ ] **Develop Interactive Control Interface:** Create a UI with controls for pausing, playing, and manipulating the datamoshing process.
        *   *Success Rubric:* User interface tests confirm all controls are functional and responsive.
    *   [ ] **Implement Multi-View Display:** Create different views for debugging and observing the process (e.g., input, DCT, difference, accumulator, output).
        *   *Success Rubric:* Visualizer displays all specified views accurately, as verified by visual inspection and automated tests.

### Milestone 2: Implement Core Datamoshing Features

*   **Success Rubric:** The integrated system successfully applies DCT, difference, and accumulation operations to the video stream, producing visible datamoshing effects in the visualizer.
*   **Subordinate Goals:**
    *   [ ] **Integrate DCT Module:** Connect the DCT service to the data pipeline to perform forward and inverse DCT operations on video frames.
        *   *Success Rubric:* Unit and integration tests for the DCT module pass, and its output is correctly displayed in the visualizer.
    *   [ ] **Integrate Difference Module:** Incorporate the Difference service to calculate and apply differences between frames.
        *   *Success Rubric:* Unit and integration tests for the Difference module pass, and its effects are visible in the visualizer.
    *   [ ] **Integrate Accumulator Module:** Connect the Accumulator service to manage and apply accumulated differences over time.
        *   *Success Rubric:* Unit and integration tests for the Accumulator module pass, and its effects are correctly applied and displayed.
    *   [ ] **Integrate Reference Frame Manager:** Ensure the Reference Frame Manager provides and updates reference frames for processing.
        *   *Success Rubric:* Unit tests for the Reference Frame Manager pass, and the system correctly utilizes reference frames.

### Milestone 3: Establish Performance Benchmarking & Optimization Strategy

*   **Success Rubric:** A comprehensive benchmarking suite is in place, capable of identifying performance bottlenecks and guiding optimization efforts towards real-time processing.
*   **Subordinate Goals:**
    *   [ ] **Develop Benchmarking Suite:** Create a set of benchmarks to measure the performance of each module and the end-to-end system.
        *   *Success Rubric:* Benchmarking suite runs successfully and generates accurate performance metrics for all modules.
    *   [ ] **Identify Bottlenecks:** Analyze benchmark results to pinpoint performance bottlenecks within the processing pipeline.
        *   *Success Rubric:* Bottlenecks are clearly identified and documented based on benchmark data.
    *   [ ] **Formulate Optimization Plan:** Develop a strategy for addressing identified bottlenecks, including potential parallelization techniques.
        *   *Success Rubric:* A detailed optimization plan is created, outlining specific steps and expected performance improvements.
