### Within-Session Checklist: June 28, 2025

#### Goal: Stabilize and Validate the CORS Debugging Environment

*   **Success Rubric:** The `CORS-debug-mesh` is fully operational, with automated startup and shutdown scripts. The visualizer correctly displays the processed video stream, confirming the test case design.
*   **Failure Rubric:** The debug environment is not stable, scripts fail, or the visualizer does not display the expected "pinkified" output.

#### Subordinate Goals:

*   **[X] Implement Automated Startup/Shutdown Scripts:**
    *   *Description:* Create `start_services.sh` and `kill_ports.sh` scripts within the `CORS-debug-mesh` directory to manage the lifecycle of the debugging services.
    *   *Success Rubric:* The scripts reliably start and stop all necessary services (`echo_service.py`, `videostream_service.py`, `proxy_server.py`) on their designated ports.
    *   *Failure Rubric:* Scripts fail to execute correctly, or services are not managed as expected.

*   **[X] Validate Visualizer Test Case:**
    *   *Description:* Critically review the last baton pass handoff by restarting the `CORS-debug-mesh` and verifying that the visualizer displays the "pinkified date and time canvases".
    *   *Success Rubric:* The user confirms that the visualizer is working as expected, validating the test case design.
    *   *Failure Rubric:* The visualizer does not display the correct output, indicating a regression or a flaw in the test case design.
