# Handoff Report: 20250628_131000

## Session Goal

Add a kill script and startup script to CORSDEBUG matching the functionality of the kill_ports.sh, so that the CORSDEBUG testing loop automatically purges previous revisions of running code when the start script is used. Then critically review the last batonpass handoff by restarting the corsdebug mesh and refactoring until i too, the user, can see pinkified date and time canvases, validating the test case design.

## Progress Report

The `CORS-debug-mesh` has been successfully refactored and is now fully functional. The following tasks were completed:

*   A `kill_ports.sh` script was created in `CORS-debug-mesh/` to terminate processes on the correct ports (5000, 5001, 5010).
*   A `start_services.sh` script was created in `CORS-debug-mesh/` to automate the process of killing old services and starting the new ones.
*   The `proxy_server.py`, `videostream_service.py`, and `echo_service.py` were confirmed to be running on the correct ports.
*   The user has confirmed that the visualizer is working as expected, displaying the "pinkified date and time canvases".

## Next Steps

*   The `CORS-debug-mesh` can now be used as a stable testbed for further development of the visualizer and related services.
*   The next development sprint can focus on implementing the actual datamoshing logic in the `echo_service.py` placeholder.
*   The main project checklist should be updated to reflect the completion of the `CORS-debug-mesh` setup.
