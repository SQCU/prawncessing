# Work Completed

1.  **Created `visualizer_service.py`:** A new Flask service was created to serve the `visualizer.html` file on port 5009.
2.  **Updated `start_services.sh`:** The script was updated to start the new `visualizer_service.py` alongside the other services.
3.  **Updated `proxy_server.py`:** The proxy was updated to route requests from the root path (`/`) to the new `visualizer_service.py`.
4.  **Created `test_visualizer_integration.py`:** A new Playwright test was created to navigate to the visualizer page through the proxy and assert that the title is correct.
5.  **Updated `kill_ports.sh`:** The script was updated to terminate the process on port 5009 when cleaning up.
6.  **Successfully ran the integration test:** The new test was executed successfully, verifying the entire integration.

# Progress Report

The visualizer for the `cors_debug_mesh` is now served through the same proxy as the other services, which is a significant improvement over the previous manual testing method. This allows for more robust and automated testing of the visualizer and its integration with the other services.

# Next Steps

*   **Refactor the visualizer:** The `visualizer.html` file contains a lot of inline JavaScript. This should be extracted into a separate file to improve maintainability.
*   **Add more tests:** The current integration test only checks the page title. More tests should be added to verify the functionality of the visualizer, such as checking if the canvas elements are present and if the video stream is loading.
*   **Address Playwright dependency warnings:** The Playwright installation produced warnings about missing host dependencies. These should be addressed to ensure the tests run reliably in different environments.
