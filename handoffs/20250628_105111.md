# Handoff Report - 

## Session Goal
The primary goal of this session was to finalize the previous work by committing the addition of Playwright browser automation for regression testing. A meta-goal was to ensure the "Baton Pass" protocol was followed correctly, including the versioning of the handoff reports themselves.

## Work Completed
*   **Committed Browser Automation:** Staged and committed the new Playwright test script (), the updated , and the associated fixes to the visualizer files.
*   **Formalized Handoff Protocol:** Updated  to include the explicit rule that all handoff reports in the  directory must be tracked in Git.
*   **Tracked Handoff Reports:** Added the previously untracked handoff reports to Git and amended the commit to include them, ensuring a complete project history.
*   **Reverted Unauthorized Change:** Correctly reverted an unauthorized modification to  upon user request, adhering to operational protocols.

## Progress Report
The project is in a stable state. The addition of the Playwright test provides a robust mechanism for detecting front-end and integration regressions. The project's core documentation () has been updated to reflect improved agent protocols. The repository now correctly tracks all necessary files, including the critical handoff reports.

## Next Steps
1.  **Diagnose Blank Canvas Issue:** The primary remaining task is to diagnose why the  remains blank, as confirmed by the Playwright test. The issue is located in the client-side JavaScript ().
2.  **Implement and Verify Fix:** Correct the JavaScript logic to ensure the video processing loop functions as expected and renders the output.
3.  **Confirm with Automation:** Use the existing  script to verify that the fix is working and the output canvas is no longer blank.

## Blockers & Questions
*   None. The path forward is clear and the immediate issue is isolated to the client-side JavaScript.
