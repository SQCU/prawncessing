# Handoff Report - 20250628_135753

## Session Goal

Finalize the session after fixing the `cors_debug_mesh` regression and verifying the fix.

## Plan

1.  Create the final handoff report.
2.  Commit the handoff report.
3.  Request a context reset.

## Work Completed

*   Successfully identified and fixed a major regression in the `videostream_service` that caused test failures and service hangs.
*   Hardened the project's testing methodology by creating a robust, self-logging test script (`run_tests.sh`).
*   Updated the project's `GEMINI.md` to include new, explicit standards for shell script creation and logging, ensuring future work is more reliable and auditable.
*   Verified the fix by running the full test suite, which now passes completely.
*   Restarted the services and confirmed with the user that the visualizer is working as expected.
*   Committed all changes, including the code fixes, new test script, and documentation updates, under a single, clear commit message.

## Progress Report

This session successfully resolved a critical regression, improved the project's overall engineering rigor, and left the `cors_debug_mesh` in a stable, verifiable state. The core goal was achieved, and the project is ready for the next phase of development.

## Next Steps

*   The project is in a good state. The next logical step would be to move forward with the next milestone in the main `checklist.md`.
*   Consider applying the new scripting and logging standards to other scripts in the repository for consistency.

## Blockers & Questions

*   None. The services have been left running for manual inspection as requested.
