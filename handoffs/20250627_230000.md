# Handoff Report - 20250627_230000

## Session Goal

Review the checklist files and complete the integration of the new, routable, functional, networked API services required by the signal processing visualizer. All interactions between a visualization client and the APIs should be through a reverse proxy service to prevent future CORS issues.

## Plan

*   [X] **Grounding:** Review `GEMINI.md` and `checklist-session-20250627.md` to understand the current project state and immediate goals.
*   [X] **Proxy Analysis:** Examine the existing `proxy_server.py` to understand its current routing logic.
*   [X] **Service Discovery:** Identify the specific service endpoints for the new functional processor services.
*   [X] **Proxy Integration:** Modify `proxy_server.py` to add routes for the new services.
*   [X] **Client-Side Update:** Analyze `visualizer_v2.js` and confirm its configuration.
*   [X] **Verification:** Attempt to start all services and verify integration.

## Work Completed

*   **Grounding:** Reviewed `GEMINI.md` and `checklist-session-20250627.md`.
*   **Dependency Installation:** Identified and installed missing Python dependencies (`flask`, `flask-cors`, `requests`) using `uv` and updated `requirements.txt`.
*   **Script Standardization:** Updated all service startup scripts (`start_visualizer_services.sh`, `functional_processor/start_functional_processors.sh`) to use `uv run python` for consistency and to ensure the correct Python environment is used.
*   **Consolidated Startup Script:** Created a new `start_all.sh` script to manage the startup and shutdown of all relevant services.
*   **CORS Resolution:** Correctly configured the `proxy_server.py` with specific CORS policies to allow requests from the visualizer, resolving the cross-origin issue.
*   **Initial Integration:** Successfully integrated the proxy with most of the backend services, as confirmed by log analysis showing successful `200 OK` responses.

## Progress Report

Significant progress was made in integrating the backend services with the visualizer via the reverse proxy. The initial setup, dependency management, and CORS issues have been resolved. Most services are now communicating successfully. However, the integration is incomplete due to a persistent, silent failure of a critical component.

## Next Steps

*   **Debug `videostream_mock_server`:** The immediate next step is to diagnose why the `videostream_mock_server.py` fails to start, even though it doesn't produce any obvious errors in its log file. This is the primary blocker.
*   **Full End-to-End Test:** Once all services are confirmed to be running, perform a complete test of the visualizer to ensure all data is being displayed correctly.
*   **Code Cleanup:** Review and potentially consolidate the various startup scripts to improve maintainability.

## Blockers & Questions

*   **`videostream_mock_server` Silent Failure:** The `videostream_mock_server.py` on port 8003 is not running, despite the startup scripts attempting to launch it. The log file only contains a deprecation warning and no errors, and `lsof` confirms nothing is listening on the port. This silent failure prevents the full system from functioning.
