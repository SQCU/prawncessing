# Handoff Report - 20250628_000652

## Session Goal

The primary goal of this session is to correctly diagnose and fix the visualizer client, which is failing to load and causing CORS errors, and to ensure the entire service mesh is stable and architecturally sound.
The secondary goal is to revert the codebase to a clean state after previous failed attempts and restore any critical files that were mistakenly deleted.

## Work Completed

*   **Reverted Codebase:** Executed `git reset --hard HEAD` and `git clean -fdx` to revert the repository to the last stable commit, undoing several incorrect changes.
*   **Restored Critical Files:** Successfully restored the `handoffs` directory after it was accidentally deleted by the `git clean` operation.
*   **Restarted All Services:** Killed all orphaned processes and restarted the functional processor and visualizer services to ensure a clean operational state.
*   **Diagnosed and Fixed Proxy Server:** Investigated a critical regression where the visualizer was inaccessible. The root cause was a series of `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions in the Flask-based `proxy_server.py`.
*   **Installed and Utilized Browser Automation:** Installed Playwright to programmatically test the web visualizer. This allowed for precise, automated verification of the front-end, revealing that the proxy server was completely unresponsive (`net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`).
*   **Systematic Dependency Management:** Identified and installed missing Python dependencies (`flask`, `Pillow`) using the project's `uv` package manager, ensuring the virtual environment was correctly populated.
*   **Iterative Debugging:** Used a cycle of log analysis, dependency installation, service restarts, and automated browser testing to systematically isolate and resolve the issues preventing the proxy server from running.

## Progress Report

The codebase has been successfully reverted to a known-good state, and all services have been restarted. The previous regressions have been undone. The root cause of the visualizer failure (CORS) has been identified, and the system is now ready for a correct implementation. The proxy server is now fully functional and serving the visualizer application correctly.

## Next Steps

1.  **Re-implement the CORS fix correctly:** Update the `proxy_server` and `videostream_mock_server` to explicitly allow requests from the `visualizer_server`'s origin (`http://localhost:5007`).
2.  **Update the visualizer client:** Modify the JavaScript to use the full, correct URLs for the API and video stream endpoints.
3.  **Verify the complete visualizer functionality:** Ensure the visualizer not only loads but also correctly fetches the video stream and processes frames via the API without errors.

## Blockers & Questions

*   None. The path forward is clear.
