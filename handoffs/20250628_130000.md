Session Goal: Use Playwright automation to implement a simple 'videostream service' which always returns a rendered image of the time and date passed to a canvas, a simple 'videostream visualizer client' which connects to the videostream service through a CORS-respecting internal transparent proxy, and a test case / unit test which demonstrate the 'videostream service' passing ten frames of 'videostream' (arbitrary, configurable parameter) per second to the visualizer client. The goal here is to specifically debug and demonstrate code style and semantics for interservice routing, and practices for extending service meshes through using transparent proxies/routers.

Plan:
1.  **Videostream Service:** Create a Python Flask service that generates an image with the current timestamp.
2.  **Visualizer Client:** Create a simple HTML/JS page that fetches and displays the image from the videostream service.
3.  **Proxy Server:** Create a Python Flask proxy to route requests from the client to the videostream service, handling CORS.
4.  **Playwright Test:** Write a Playwright test to verify the whole system is working, checking for 10 frames per second.

Work Completed:
1.  Created `CORS-debug-mesh` directory.
2.  Created `videostream_service.py` - a Flask app that serves a JPEG image with the current timestamp.
3.  Created `visualizer.html` - an HTML page that displays the video stream.
4.  Created `proxy_server.py` - a Flask app that proxies requests from the visualizer to the videostream service.
5.  Created `test_visualizer.py` - a Playwright test that verifies the frame rate of the video stream.
6.  Successfully ran the test and verified the system is working.

Progress Report:
Successfully created and tested the entire videostream pipeline, including the service, client, and proxy. The Playwright test confirms that the system can achieve the desired frame rate. This provides a solid foundation for more complex video processing and visualization tasks.

Next Steps:
1.  Integrate this debug mesh with the existing functional processors.
2.  Replace the simple timestamp image with actual processed video frames.
3.  Develop more comprehensive tests for different scenarios.

Blockers & Questions:
None.
