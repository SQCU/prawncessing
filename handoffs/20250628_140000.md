## Session Goal
Add a service monitoring wrapper to the 'video synthesizer' and 'striping pinkifier' services in corsdebug to measure the effects of memoizing, buffering, rate limiting, etc. on the hardware thread consumption / saturation of their respective services.

## Plan
1.  Identify the service files for "video synthesizer" and "striping pinkifier" in `CORS-debug-mesh`.
2.  Read the identified service files to understand their structure.
3.  Add `psutil` to `CORS-debug-mesh/requirements.txt` to gather system metrics.
4.  Implement a monitoring wrapper in one of the services to log CPU and memory usage.
5.  Apply the monitoring wrapper to the core logic of both services.
6.  Update the `start_services.sh` script if necessary.

## Work Completed
1.  Identified `videostream_service.py` as the "video synthesizer". No "striping pinkifier" service was found.
2.  Read `videostream_service.py` and `proxy_server.py`.
3.  Added `psutil` to `CORS-debug-mesh/requirements.txt`.
4.  Implemented a monitoring wrapper in `videostream_service.py` to log CPU and memory usage.
5.  Applied the monitoring wrapper to the video generation logic.
6.  Updated `start_services.sh` to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Progress Report
The `videostream_service.py` has been successfully wrapped with a monitoring decorator that logs CPU and memory usage. The `start_services.sh` script has been updated to ensure the necessary `psutil` dependency is installed. The original request mentioned a "striping pinkifier" service, which was not found in the specified directory. The monitoring has been applied to the existing "video synthesizer" (`videostream_service.py`) as a representative implementation.

## Next Steps
1.  Run the `start_services.sh` script to confirm the monitoring is working as expected.
2.  Analyze the logs to see the performance metrics.
3.  If a "striping pinkifier" service exists elsewhere, locate it and apply the same monitoring wrapper.

## Blockers & Questions
- The "striping pinkifier" service was not found. If this service is critical, its location needs to be identified.
