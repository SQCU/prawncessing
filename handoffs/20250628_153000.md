# Handoff Report - 20250628_153000

## Session Goal
Refactor the unit tests in `cors_debug_mesh` to be integration tests that report failures between API contracts, even if internal constructs pass their internal tests.

## Progress Report
*   **Refactored `test_videostream_service.py`:** The existing unit test was refactored into an integration test that uses the Flask test client to make a real request to the `/video` endpoint.
*   **Created `test_api_contracts.py`:** A new test file was created to explicitly test the API contracts of the `echo` and `videostream` services. These tests use the `requests` library to make live HTTP requests to the running services.
*   **Debugging and Environment:** A significant portion of the session was spent debugging issues related to the test environment. This included:
    *   Installing missing dependencies (`pytest-timeout`, `playwright`).
    *   Resolving `OSError` due to a missing font file in the `videostream_service`.
    *   Fixing `IndentationError` and `SyntaxError` introduced during debugging.
    *   Identifying and documenting the need to activate the `uv` virtual environment before running tests.
*   **Log Analysis Script:** A Python script (`log_analyzer.py`) was created to post-process verbose log files and identify repeated n-grams, aiding in the analysis of test output.

## Next Steps
*   **Resolve Failing Tests:** The `test_videostream_service_contract` and `test_video_feed` tests are still failing due to timeouts. The root cause of this needs to be investigated and fixed.
*   **Improve Test Robustness:** The tests could be made more robust by using a tool like `flaky` to handle intermittent failures.
*   **Expand Test Coverage:** Add more integration tests to cover other aspects of the services, such as error handling for different types of invalid input.

## Blockers & Questions
*   The `pytest-timeout` plugin seems to be interacting poorly with the `videostream_service`. The exact cause of this is still unknown and requires further investigation.
