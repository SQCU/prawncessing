# Handoff Report: 20250627_225147

## Session Goal

The user's goal was to diagnose and address the recurring issue of AI agents getting "stuck" in unproductive loops, and to establish a more robust workflow for handoff between short, focused work sessions.

## Plan

1.  **Diagnose the "Stuck State":** Analyze project meta-files (`GEMINI.md`, `debriefs/GEMINI.md`, checklists) to identify the root causes of agent looping.
2.  **Propose a Solution:** Develop a new, structured protocol to ensure clear, incremental progress and effective handoffs between agent sessions.
3.  **Implement the Protocol:**
    *   Create a `handoffs/` directory for the new reports.
    *   Formalize the "Baton Pass Protocol" in `GEMINI.md`.
4.  **Refine the Protocol:** Incorporate user feedback to add "live tracing" to the protocol, ensuring that even interrupted sessions leave a valuable trace.

## Work Completed

*   **Created `handoffs/` directory:** Successfully created the directory to store session handoff reports.
*   **Pruned `TO-FUTURE-GEMINIS.md`:** Emptied the file to reduce confusing and potentially error-inducing instructions for future agents.
*   **Refactored `GEMINI.md`:**
    *   Consolidated several disparate sections into a single, clear "Operational Guidelines" section.
    *   Removed outdated and redundant information.
*   **Established "Baton Pass Protocol":**
    *   Defined and documented the initial "Baton Pass Protocol" in `GEMINI.md`.
    *   Revised the protocol to "Baton Pass Protocol (v2 - Live Tracing)" based on user feedback, adding live logging of session goals, plans, and actions.

## Progress Report

This session successfully transitioned the project's meta-level workflow to a more robust, structured, and traceable system. The new "Baton Pass Protocol" is now in place and documented in `GEMINI.md`. This protocol is designed to prevent the kind of unproductive loops that were previously plaguing the project, and to ensure that each agent session, successful or not, provides a clear record of its intentions and actions.

## Next Steps

1.  **Initiate the First "Baton Pass" Work Sprint:** The next agent should begin by following the new protocol, starting with a user-provided Situating Instruction.
2.  **Consolidate Checklists:** While the historical nature of the checklists is now noted, the next agent could propose a plan to consolidate them into a single, master `checklist.md` to streamline project tracking, while preserving the historical checklists in an `archive/` directory.
3.  **Review `SCRIPT_DOCUMENTATION.md`:** The documentation in this file is likely outdated due to recent refactoring. The next agent should review and update it to reflect the current state of the project's scripts.

## Blockers & Questions

None.
