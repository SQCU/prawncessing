# Handoff Report - 20250627_230500

## Session Goal

> batonpass protocol time! review the previous batonpass, sternly critiquing it for narrowmindedness and treating project code as a source of truth instead of the project's reference schema (which can be found in the root dir with DCT-DIFF*). destructively refactor the visualizer so that it adheres to the overall project architecture. once you've checked that the related files are tracked in the git history, you have total freedom to shred, flay, maim, and dismember fragments of code that track an obsolete spec prone to CORS issues and so on. figure out how to use unit tests to make sure that all services in the signal processing chain are accessible through the reverse proxy router, and only then write a spec sheet for how a visualizer client can be served so that it's internal requests don't scare the browser or mess with the browser's security model. the spec sheet and critique are your batonpass goal, not code edits or deletions right now.

## Plan
1.  **Grounding:** Review the last handoff report (`handoffs/20250627_230000.md`), the project's architectural schema (`DCT-DIFF-DELAY-DATAMOSH.png`), and recent debriefings (`debriefs/GEMINI.md`) to establish a full understanding of the project state and intended architecture.
2.  **Critique:** Write a stern critique of the previous session's approach, focusing on its failure to adhere to the architectural schema, leading to getting bogged down in implementation-specific issues like CORS instead of addressing the flawed architecture.
3.  **Verification Strategy:** Formulate a unit testing strategy to validate that all backend services are correctly routed and accessible through the project's reverse proxy. This is a prerequisite for designing a compliant visualizer.
4.  **Specification Sheet:** Develop a clear specification sheet for a new visualizer client. This document will outline how the client should be served and how it must interact with the backend via the proxy to align with the project's architecture and avoid browser security issues.
5.  **Finalize Handoff:** Complete this report with a summary of progress, actionable next steps, and any identified blockers, then request a context reset.

## Work Completed

*   **Grounding & Analysis:** I have completed a thorough review of the provided context, including the previous handoff report (`handoffs/20250627_230000.md`), the core architectural diagram (`DCT-DIFF-DELAY-DATAMOSH.png`), and the `GEMINI.md` meta-documentation. This analysis forms the foundation for the critique and specification below.
*   **Critique of Previous Session:** A detailed critique has been authored, focusing on the previous session's critical flaw: treating the buggy, implementation-level code as the source of truth instead of adhering to the project's explicit architectural schema. This led to a narrow-minded focus on fixing symptoms (like CORS errors) rather than addressing the root architectural misalignment.
*   **Visualizer Specification Sheet:** A comprehensive specification for a new visualizer client has been developed. This specification outlines a robust, architecturally-compliant approach that will prevent the security and network issues that plagued previous attempts. It defines a clear separation of concerns, with the client acting as a simple static interface and a reverse proxy handling all complex backend orchestration.

## Critique of Previous Baton Pass (Session: 20250627_230000)

The previous session, while demonstrating diligence in debugging, was fundamentally and critically flawed. It operated from a position of tactical myopia, treating the existing, broken codebase as a sacred text to be deciphered and appeased. This is a profound misunderstanding of its role. The agent's purpose is not to perform digital archaeology on obsolete code but to execute a clear architectural vision.

The core failure was one of **architectural insubordination**. The project's canonical reference is the `DCT-DIFF-DELAY-DATAMOSH.png` schema, which lays out a clear, decoupled data flow. Instead of using this schema as the blueprint for its work, the agent fixated on the `visualizer_v2.js` and `proxy_server.py` implementations. It became trapped in a loop of trying to fix symptoms—most notably CORS errors and service startup failures—that were direct consequences of a fundamentally incorrect architecture.

Getting bogged down in CORS issues is a tell-tale sign of this error. CORS is a browser security model, and fighting it is a losing battle that signals a deep misunderstanding of web fundamentals. The architecture, if followed, would have obviated these issues entirely by ensuring the client *only ever communicates with the proxy from which it was served*. The frantic attempts to apply `flask-cors` were a band-aid on a hemorrhaging wound, treating the symptom while the underlying disease of architectural deviation was allowed to fester.

Furthermore, the obsession with the "silent failure" of the `videostream_mock_server` was a red herring. While a problem, its resolution would not have fixed the core issue. The agent was trying to revive a single organ in a body whose circulatory system was fundamentally misconfigured. The goal is not to make individual services run in isolation; it is to make them work *together* as defined by the project schema, orchestrated cleanly through a reverse proxy that hides this complexity from the client.

In short, the previous session was a masterclass in missing the forest for the trees. It treated the implementation as the spec, wasted valuable time on tactical fixes for a strategically flawed system, and failed to uphold its primary duty: to build according to the provided architectural blueprint.

## Specification Sheet: The Architecturally-Compliant Visualizer

This document outlines the specification for a new visualizer client and its interaction with the backend, adhering strictly to the project's reference schema.

### 1. Core Principles

*   **Separation of Concerns:** The system is divided into two distinct parts:
    1.  **The Backend Service Mesh:** A collection of independent, single-purpose Python services (DCT, Difference, Accumulator, etc.) that perform the core signal processing tasks.
    2.  **The Visualizer Client:** A static, browser-based application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) whose *only* purpose is to capture user input (e.g., an image frame) and display the processed output.
*   **Proxy as the Single Point of Truth:** The client **MUST NOT** have any knowledge of the individual backend services. All communication between the client and the backend **MUST** be routed through a single reverse proxy/API gateway. This is non-negotiable.

### 2. Client Implementation

*   **Static Serving:** The visualizer client (e.g., `visualizer_v3.html`, `visualizer_v3.js`) will be served as a set of static files by a simple, dedicated web server. This server's *only* role is to deliver these files to the browser. The `proxy_server.py` itself can and should perform this function.
*   **Client Logic:** The client-side JavaScript will be responsible for:
    1.  Capturing a video frame from the user's webcam or a file.
    2.  Encoding the frame data (e.g., as a Base64-encoded string).
    3.  Sending this data in a single `POST` request to a designated endpoint on the proxy server (e.g., `/api/v1/process-frame`).
    4.  Receiving the processed image from the proxy in the response.
    5.  Rendering the received image in a canvas or `<img>` element.
*   **No Direct Service Calls:** There will be zero instances of the client attempting to call `localhost:8001`, `localhost:8002`, etc. All `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` calls will be directed to the same origin that served the HTML file (e.g., `/api/v1/process-frame`).

### 3. Proxy / API Gateway Implementation (`proxy_server.py`)

*   **Static File Serving:** The proxy will have a route (e.g., `/`) that serves the static `visualizer_v3.html` and its related assets.
*   **API Endpoint:** The proxy will expose a single, primary API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/v1/process-frame`) to the client.
*   **Backend Orchestration:** Upon receiving a request at the API endpoint, the proxy is responsible for executing the entire data processing pipeline as defined in `DCT-DIFF-DELAY-DATAMOSH.png`. This involves a sequence of internal, server-to-server HTTP requests:
    1.  Receive image from client.
    2.  `POST` image to the `DCT Service`.
    3.  `POST` reference frame to the `DCT Service`.
    4.  `POST` the two DCT results to the `Difference Service`.
    5.  `POST` the difference result and the original DCT to the `Accumulator/Summer Service`.
    6.  `POST` the final DCT result to the `Inverse DCT Service`.
    7.  Return the final image to the client in the HTTP response.
*   **Error Handling:** The proxy will manage all errors from the backend services and return a meaningful HTTP status code (e.g., `502 Bad Gateway`, `503 Service Unavailable`) to the client if any part of the chain fails.

### 4. Verification and Unit Testing Strategy

Before a single line of the new visualizer client is written, the integrity of the backend service mesh and proxy orchestration **MUST** be verified.

*   **Test Objective:** To confirm that a request to the proxy's public API endpoint successfully triggers the entire chain of internal service calls and produces a valid output.
*   **Methodology:** A Python test script (e.g., `test_proxy_orchestration.py`) will be created. This script will:
    1.  Load a sample input image.
    2.  Make a `POST` request to the proxy's public endpoint (`/api/v1/process-frame`) with the image data.
    3.  Assert that the HTTP response code is `200 OK`.
    4.  Assert that the response content is a valid image.
    5.  **(Optional but Recommended)** Use a mocking library to inspect the logs of the individual backend services to ensure each one was called in the correct order.

This testing strategy validates the entire system from the client's perspective, ensuring the backend is architecturally sound and ready for a compliant client to be built. It shifts the focus from debugging disparate services to testing the integrated, orchestrated whole.

## Progress Report

The session's primary goal has been achieved. I have completed a comprehensive analysis of the project's architecture and the previous session's shortcomings. A stern but necessary critique has been delivered, highlighting the critical need to adhere to the project's architectural schema rather than getting lost in implementation-specific details.

Most importantly, a clear, actionable specification sheet for a new, architecturally-compliant visualizer has been created. This specification, if followed, will eliminate the network and security issues (like CORS) that have plagued previous efforts by establishing a clean separation of concerns and routing all communication through a single, orchestrating reverse proxy. A detailed unit testing strategy has also been defined to validate the backend service mesh before any new client-side code is written.

This session has successfully course-corrected the project, moving it from a reactive, debugging-focused state to a strategic, architecturally-driven one. The baton is now ready to be passed with a clear and correct plan of action.

## Next Steps

*   **Implement the Verification Test:** The immediate next step is to implement the `test_proxy_orchestration.py` script as defined in the specification sheet. This is a critical prerequisite to any further development.
*   **Destructive Refactoring:** Once the backend is verified, begin the destructive refactoring of the old visualizer code (`visualizer_v2.html`, `visualizer_v2.js`, etc.) and the `proxy_server.py` to align with the new specification.
*   **Build the New Client:** Create the new visualizer client (`visualizer_v3.html`, `visualizer_v3.js`) according to the provided spec.

## Blockers & Questions

There are no immediate blockers. The path forward is clear. The only question is one of execution and adherence to the new specification.
