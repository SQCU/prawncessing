## Session Goal

Add a new feature to the CORSDEBUG subproject: an echo server which takes an image submitted by the visualizer client, and returns it but with pink stripes added and a 3% shear of the image in a random direction. this necessarily means extending the CORSDEBUG visualization client to include a new canvas for the returned images and writing a little bit of test code to compare image hashes and compare image pinkosity.

## Plan

1.  **Setup:** Create the new echo server file (`echo_service.py`) and its corresponding test file (`test_echo_service.py`) within the `CORS-debug-mesh` directory.
2.  **Echo Server Implementation:** Implement the Flask server in `echo_service.py`. It will have an endpoint that accepts an image, uses the Pillow library to apply pink stripes and a random shear, and returns the modified image.
3.  **Client-Side Updates:** Modify `visualizer.html` to include a second canvas for the processed image. Add JavaScript to capture a frame from the first canvas, send it to the new echo server, and display the returned image on the second canvas.
4.  **Testing:** Implement tests in `test_echo_service.py`. This will involve creating a test image, sending it to the server, and then verifying the output by checking for the presence of pink pixels and comparing image hashes (if feasible with the random shear).
5.  **Dependencies:** Check for and add `Pillow` to the `requirements.txt` file if it's not already present.
6.  **Documentation:** Update any relevant startup or testing scripts to include the new echo service.

## Work Completed

*   Created `echo_service.py` and `test_echo_service.py`.
*   Implemented the echo server with image manipulation (pink stripes and random shear).
*   Updated `visualizer.html` to include a second canvas and the necessary JavaScript to interact with the echo server.
*   Wrote tests for the echo server and verified they pass.
*   Added `Pillow` to the project dependencies.
*   Updated `start_visualizer_services.sh` to include the new echo server.
*   Created `requirements-test.txt` for the `CORS-debug-mesh` subproject.

## Progress Report

The echo server feature has been successfully implemented and tested. The `CORS-debug-mesh` subproject now has a new service that demonstrates receiving an image, processing it, and returning it to the client. The visualizer has been updated to display the processed image, providing a complete end-to-end example.

## Next Steps

*   Manually test the full pipeline by running `start_visualizer_services.sh` and opening `CORS-debug-mesh/visualizer.html` in a browser.
*   Refactor the `start_visualizer_services.sh` script to be more modular, perhaps taking arguments for which services to start.
*   Consider adding more sophisticated image processing options to the echo server.

## Blockers & Questions

*   None.
